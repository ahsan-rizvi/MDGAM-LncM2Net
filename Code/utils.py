"""
Sample version of custom loss functions module.

This file provides example implementations of tailored loss functions for binary 
classification tasks, particularly addressing class imbalance often observed in 
biomedical datasets.

Functions included:
    - Binary cross-entropy for individual classes (e.g., LTS vs non-LTS)
    - Combined BCE loss for imbalanced datasets
    - Focal loss for emphasizing hard-to-classify samples

Note: This is a sample file. Full implementation will be available after publication.

"""
Sample version of the data loading and graph construction module.

This file outlines utility functions for:
    - Loading transcriptomic expression data and pathway annotations
    - Constructing heterogeneous graphs (e.g., ceRNA and PPI networks) using DGL
    - Preprocessing edge data and visualizing model weights for interpretability

Key components:
    - load_allData: Loads multi-omics gene expression data into structured dictionaries
    - load_pathway / load_pathway2: Loads pathway data and converts it into torch tensors
    - create_PPI_g: Builds a DGL graph from ceRNA interactions and PPI data
    - new_ceRNA: Filters and exports selected ceRNA edges based on edge weights

Note: This is a sample file. Full implementation will be available after publication.
